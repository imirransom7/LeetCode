# Write your MySQL query statement below
# writing a query that finds the classes that have at least 5 students
# To do this, I select the class column from the courses table, grouping by the class column.
# Then I use a HAVING clause since we cannot use the WHERE clause while using an aggregate. It is 
# used to pass the condition to see if the count of the classes are at least 5
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(class) >= 5;
