# Write your MySQL query statement below

# Joining both tables off of the primary key empId and seeing which employees have bonuses less than 1000
# I use a LEFT OUTER JOIN because I am to query out those who do not have bonuses i.e. NULL values. If an
# INNER JOIN is used, those NULL values will not appear in the query. So, to make sure the NULL values show up,
# I pass a condition that will give me the bonuses less than 1000 and if the bonus is also NULL
SELECT Employee.name, Bonus.bonus
FROM Employee
LEFT JOIN Bonus
ON Employee.empId=Bonus.empId
WHERE Bonus.bonus < 1000 OR Bonus.bonus IS NULL;
