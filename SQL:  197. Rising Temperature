# Write your MySQL query statement below


SELECT w2.id AS Id
FROM Weather AS w1
INNER JOIN Weather AS w2
# Joining on a self join by making the the second table the dates for the previous day
ON DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = -1
WHERE w2.temperature > w1.temperature;

# OR
# This is a solution without a join, just selecting twice from the same table
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather AS w1, Weather AS w2
# Then, the condition to be met is if the date difference is by -1 (by one day) and if the previous day has a higher temperature
WHERE DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate , w2.recordDate) = 1 AND WHERE w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature
