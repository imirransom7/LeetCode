# getting the first login date for each player. To do this, I use the MIN() aggregate on the even_date column to get the least/earliest time
# which will give me the first login day. Then, I use Group By statement on the player_id column to group all the players and their first login
SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login
