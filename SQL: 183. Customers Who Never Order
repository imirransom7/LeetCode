# Write your MySQL query statement below

# I made a query joing the two tables to find the customers who do not order. I joined them using a LEFT OUTER JOIN
# so that I can get the missing values as well, for an INNER JOIN will leave those values out since the table holding orders doe not have
# customer ids of those who never placed an order. And if we used INNER JOIN in this instance, we wouldn't be able to get the customers' names of
# those who never ordered, they would be lost. After, using the LEFT OUTER JOIN, I now get NULL values, so where ever the customer id is NULL in the Orders table
# for customer id. Then, I find the name of those who customer ids are not in the Order Table.
SELECT Customers.name AS Customers
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.id=Orders.customerId
WHERE Orders.customerId IS NULL;
