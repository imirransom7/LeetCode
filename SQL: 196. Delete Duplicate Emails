# Write your MySQL query statement below

# using a self join on the Person Table based on the same email value. The WHERE Clause makes it so
# the higher ids get deleted where there is an email duplicate, keeping the lower ids
DELETE e1
FROM Person AS e1
INNER JOIN Person AS e2
ON e1.email=e2.email
WHERE e1.id > e2.id;
