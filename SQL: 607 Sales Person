# Write your MySQL query statement below
# Here I was to find the sales person that did not have any orders with the 
# company 'RED'. i joined 3 tables together using the primary and foreign keys associated with each other
# and then I maade a where clause to find the sales persons that have orders with those companies, that way
# I can get the opposite names i.e. the ones who do not have orders with the company querying over this query with
# a select statement that will have a where clause querying the the sales persons that are not with the nested select statement
